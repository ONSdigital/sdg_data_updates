# creates csv for countries in UK under 5 child mortality data

# read in data -----------------------------------------------------------------

#' The data was read in using the xlsx_cells function in compile_tables.R so that 
#' we can use the behead function below (trim data). This is not strictly necessary 
#' for this table because there is one simple header row. If, in future years it 
#' all goes pear shaped, I've left another simpler method hashed out below

#UK_source_data <- read_excel(paste0(input_folder, "/", filename), sheet = tabname_UK,
                             #skip = header_row_UK - 1)

united_kingdom <- dplyr::filter(source_data, sheet == tabname_UK)


# trim data ----------------------------------------------------------------

#UK_data_trim <- UK_source_data %>%
  #select("Year", "Live births", "Infant under 1 year", "Childhood deaths 1â€“4 years")

info_cells <- SDGupdater::get_info_cells(united_kingdom, header_row_UK)
year <- SDGupdater::unique_to_string(info_cells$Year)
country <- SDGupdater::unique_to_string(info_cells$Country)

main_data <- united_kingdom %>%
  mutate(character = str_squish(character)) %>%
  remove_blanks_and_info_cells(header_row_UK) %>%
  mutate(character = suppressWarnings(remove_superscripts(character)))

# tidy data up into a more usable table
tidy_data <- main_data %>%
  # these lines detail the direction of the relevant text for each data point
  unpivotr::behead("left-up", area_code) %>%
  unpivotr::behead("left-up", country) %>%
  unpivotr::behead("left", sex) %>%
  unpivotr::behead("up-left", event) %>%
  dplyr::select(area_code, country, sex, event, numeric) %>%
  # make wider so that each type of figure is in a different column
  pivot_wider(names_from = event, values_from = numeric) %>%
  # select only the columns we need for calculating rates
  select(area_code, country, sex, "Live births", )

# calculations -----------------------------------------------------------------
 
# Create column for total deaths under 5 years

# column for under under 5 death rate per 1000 live births


# make column names consistent across years ------------------------------------

# If you know a column name may change year to year you can rename these columns
# so that the code will always work regardless of the name.
# You can use the rename_column function to rename them based on patterns that 
# are always present in the column name. See below for some examples of usage.
#
# You can then use the new name to refer to the columns through the 
# rest of the code.

# If there aren't too many columns that you are going to use you could do this 
# step for all columns but be careful you don't introduce errors!

renamed_main <- main_data %>% 
  rename_column(primary = "year", new_name = "year") %>%

                new_name = "all_households_000s") %>% 
  rename_column(primary = c("sample", "size"), alternate = "count", 
                new_name = "sample_size") #%>%
  # # the following isn't something we want to do here, but to show how you
  # # match multiple potential patterns using the OR operator:
  # rename_column(primary = "type", not_pattern = "a|b|c|other",
  #               new_name = "d")

# Join dataframes, do relevant calculations etc

# some useful dplyr functions:
# left_join(), right_join, 
# add_row(), filter(), select(), group_by(), summarise()
# pivot_longer(), pivot_wider()

# If, like in type_1_data, you have multiple columns with values, e.g. where each
# holds the values for a level of a disaggregation, pivot_longer is your friend

  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(contains("type"), all_households_000s),
    names_to = "type",
    values_to = "value"
  )

# # for doing calculations, you may rather want values in separate columns, but the same row.
# # The reverse of pivot_longer is pivot wider. e.g. if I wanted to add types a and b
# # and the data were already tidy (one value per row)
# calculation_example <- tidy_data %>% 
#   pivot_wider(names_from = "type",
#               values_from = "value") %>% 
#   mutate(type_a_plus_b = as.numeric(type_a) + as.numeric(type_b))
# 
# # then back to tidy:
# example_tidied <- calculation_example %>% 
#   pivot_longer(
#     cols = c(contains("type"), all_households_000s),
#     names_to = "type",
#     values_to = "value"
