### Debug_code training
  
This task is designed to ...
  
The practice code is taken from the automation of 15-1-1. It has been consolidated into a single script and does not include the
QA element (in Rmarkown). Bugs have been introduced for debugging.  
  
#### Instructions
1. Fetch the main branch from Github
2. Create a new branch e.g. 'debugging_code_<your initials>'
3. Set this as your working branch  
4. Open RStudio
5. Open the sdg_data_updates project (File > Open Project > navigate to your cloned sdg_data_updates folder - it is in there)
6. Open the code_to_debug.R file
7. Debug away! The original code_to_debug file will remain, unchanged, on the main branch
8. Make regular commits - this way if you make an error and want to step back to an earlier version, you can.
