# read in data -----------------------------------------------------------------

#' The data was read in using the xlsx_cells function in compile_tables.R so that 
#' we can use the behead function below (trim data). This is not strictly necessary 
#' for this table because there is one simple header row. If, in future years it 
#' all goes pear shaped, I've left another simpler method hashed out below

#UK_source_data <- read_excel(paste0(input_folder, "/", filename), sheet = tabname_UK,
