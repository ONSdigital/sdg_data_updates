### Instructions to run update ###
1. *UK SDG data team:* (once this code has been reviewed and is on the main branch) Go to Jemalex > sdg_data_updates.  
   *Others:* Checkout sdg_data_updates main branch to your local repository.   
2. Open update_indicator_main.Rproj
4. Change indicator folder name (`indicator = "3-c-1_python"`)
5. Click Source (by default trhis is in top right)
6. Check for messages in the console. When the script is run a file titled '3.c.1.csv' will be saved in 3-c-1 > Output 
   Use this file for the Indicator csv
7. A file called <date>_3-c-1_checks.html will also be in the outputs folder. Read through this as a QA of the csv.

### Instructions for metada ###
The last updated date is not generated by the script. However you can get this from the bottom of the [review selections section]
  (https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=168) on Nomis.
  
  
### Decisions to be made: ### 
- Are we using the right SOC2010 codes? 
  The UN reqests a small subset of what we report - should we just be reporting those? Are there SDMX implications to including more?
  
### Code edits that may be needed: ###  
- to be SDMX compatible maybe use the subset of SOC2010 codes specified in the metadata. 
  This will require generating the nomis link agaiin and putting it in the config.R file.
  It will also require a simplification of the code:
  - get rid of the section where vets are subtracted from health professsionals
  - get a headline figure (e.g. `group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Value = sum(Value))`)
