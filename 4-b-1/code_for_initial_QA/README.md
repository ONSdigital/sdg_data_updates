Code written to QA 4-b-1 (independently written code to the main 4-b-1 code)

To run this code you will need to:
- take it out of the code_for_initial_QA folder and put it in the 4-b-1 folder
- move the files that were in the 4-b-1 folder into another folder so there is no conflict (e.g. both will have a compile_tables.R file, but they will be different).
- save the example_config.R file as config.R
- put the source data file as a csv into a folder called 'Input'
- edit the config file so that it is up to date
