specific things to QA

Rows where 'Sector (source)' or 'Sector (end user)' is not blank:
- check that all and only sectors that appear are in the original data under Sector (in bold).
- check entries in 'Sector detail' aren't missing a couple of letters at the end. Particularly check those that start with 'cropland', 'grassland', and 'settlements'
