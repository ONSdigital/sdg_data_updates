# sdg_data_updates
Code for updating SDG data files on the UK SDG platform (https://sdgdata.gov.uk/)

Most of these scripts take published data and reformat it to fit the layout required for upload to the SDG platform (OpenSDG).

There are (or will be) a few scripts that use microdata to create outputs for publishing prior to uploading to the SDG platform.

Some code that has been used to produce indicator data for the Uk are held in other repositories. 

SDGupdater is an R package with common functions used for reformatting data, printing warnings and doing calculations. While the indicators are all quite different, many of the same functions are required.
