### 16.3.2 update instructions

1) Save the Annual Prison Population tables as an xlsx file in the 'Input' folder in 16-3-2 (if this doesn't exist, make it inside the 16.3.2 folder).  
2) Open the sdg_data_updates.Rproj from inside RStudio.  
3) Open the config.R file in 16-3-2 (you can do this in the 'Files' panel in RStudio (usually a tab in the bottom right panel).  
4) Check the configurations (e.g. filename and tab names) are correct, and if not correct them and save.  
5) Open update_indicator_main.R (from sdg_data_updates.Rproj) and click 'Source' button to run the script (top right corner of the script panel).  
6) Outputs will be saved in the Outputs folder in 16-3-2 (which the script will create if it doesn't already exist).
