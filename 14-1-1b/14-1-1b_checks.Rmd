## Introduction

We use Beachwatch data from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) to report 
14-1-1b. Prior to the first time we used these data this we explored it 
thoroughly to ensure the trends were not being overly influenced by any 
variables. 
  
It is not necessary to perform all checks every year, however we do need to 
check certain aspects of the data before using it:  
1. Number of volunteers impacts the estimate - Is the range of number of 
volunteers is very different to a 'normal' year? If so, data will need further 
scrutiny and a time series break and footnote may be needed.  
2. Are there any duplicate entries that need merging into a single entry?  
3. Have any litter types been dropped that should be included?  
4. Are all litter types in the main data are matched to a litter type in the 
sources data?  
6. Do trends look sensible given previous figures?  
   
## 1. Number of volunteers
The range for number of volunteers each year can be seen in the box-plots below.  
The red line shows where number of volunteers = 10, and is just intended as a
visual guide, however I think if the inter-quartile range falls above or below
this line, we may not want to use the data for that year:  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# box plot of volunteer numbers by year.
GBBC_from_2008 %>% 
  distinct(year, survey_id, total_volunteer_count) %>% 
  ggplot(.,
       aes(x = as.numeric(year),
           y = total_volunteer_count)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = year)) +
  # facet_wrap(vars(beach_country), nrow = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 10,
             colour = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Number of volunteers') +
  ggtitle('Number of volunteers per beach')

```
   
There is a positive correlation between the number of volunteers and the
amount of plastic litter collected. Note however that this is, as there is an 
interaction with duration of survey. See QMI for details.
  
In 2020 the number of volunteers was much lower than usual (significantly 
different to many of the earlier years based on non-overlapping boxes). 
Therefore, litter counts for 2020 are likely to be an under-estimate. In 2021
the number of volunteers was higher than usual (possibly significantly so based 
on the median not overlapping the boxes of earlier years) so counts for 2021 are 
likely to be an over-estimate compared to earlier years.  
    
If the range does not look normal for the updated year please investigate and 
include a footnote in the data tables and on the platform. The observation 
status in the csv should also be changed (do all this in the 14_1_1b_update.R 
script).   

## 2. Duplicate entries
It is possible that two entries have been made for the same clean - this could
for example occur if a volunteer sheet is missed by the organiser and therefore
added as a separate entry.  
  
This is the case for the following surveys that have already been dealt with: 
`r surveys_to_sum`. Check the table below to see if any of these surveys look 
like their counts need to be summed. For example, where everything is the same
except in one the litter counts are much lower.  Make sure you check the 
comments, as some may state that two 100m surveys were carried out. All 
potential duplicates are shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
datatable(possible_repeats, 
          rownames = FALSE, 
          filter = "top",
          options = list(dom = 'tp', 
                         pageLength = 10,
                         columnDefs = list(list(
                           className = 'dt-center', targets = 0:3))))
```
## 3. Litter types not included
The full MCS data includes litter categories, such as wood and ceramic, which 
are not pertinent to the  indicator (which is only about plastic).    
  
Columns (litter types) are selected based on some key words that are set in the 
14.1.1b config file. The keywords used in this run were `r plastic_keywords`.  
  
Typos and column name changes in the data may lead to errors in future runs. 
Please check that the list of dropped columns in the table below does not 
include any items that should be included in the estimate of plastic litter. 
If there are, please edit the plastic_keywords in the config file so they are 
included.
  
It is also possible that some non-plastic litter items will be included in the 
estimate. The table showing litter type by source in the next section lists
all items used in the estimate. Please check through them - if any items
are included that should not be you may be able to edit the plastic_keywords to 
remove them, or you may need to edit 14-1-1b_update.R.  
    
Please check all pages of the table below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

print('Columns dropped from the data: ')
data.frame(`not included` = rev(columns_removed))
```


## 4. Matching of litter types to sources
There is a step in the code where litter types in the main data set are matched 
to a spreadsheet with the suspected source of each litter type. If there are 
discrepancies between the litter type names in the two datasets they will not 
join correctly.  
  
There are `r length(unmatched_litter_types)` unmatched litter types. If there 
are any they will be listed below.  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (length(unmatched_litter_types) > 0) {
  print('Unmatched litter types: ')
  unmatched_litter_types
}

```

The following table shows the litter types retained in the dataset classified by
suspected source (please check that there is nothing weird in here, and that all
items are plastic related):
```{r, echo=FALSE}
 print('Litter types included in estimate and classified by suspected source: ')
types_classified_by_source 
```

## 5. Trends
The plots below show the data plotted by year and country. Please check that 
they look reasonable, and investigate anything that looks strange.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
headline_plot <- output_data %>% 
  filter(grepl("all", tolower(source)) == TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(.,
         aes(x = year,
             y = median_count,
             colour = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   vjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("All plastic liter (all sources)")

source_plot <- output_data %>% 
  filter(substr(tolower(source), 1, 3) != "all") %>% 
  ggplot(.,
         aes(x = year,
             y = median_count,
             colour = source)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(country), nrow = 3) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   vjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Plastic liter by suspected source")

print(headline_plot)
print(source_plot)
