Create csv data for 5-6-1 (Women using Sexual and Reproductive Health Services) with disaggregations:
- Age
- Main method of contraception -> Type of contraception
- Region -> local authority

Runtime of about 30 seconds

Once finished, output folder should contain a .csv output and a .html QA checks file. Still advisable to look at the source data and check foot notes and information tabs.
In particular: 
	- Prior to 2020/21 the local authority tab is called 'Table 17', but from 2020/21 onwards it is 'Table 17a', so check the tab names haven't changed
	- Check that values being read in are thousands not percentages
	- Check the foot notes for 'Other methods', the totals are are different depending on whether age or local authority data
