### ODA indicator updates

## Introduction
There are multiple ODA inidcators that use the same source table. It therefore makes sense to run all these automations at the same time.  
  
Additional source data are:  
- exchange rate and deflator data for converting GBP to constant USD (used in several indicators)  
- GNI data for calculating ODP as a % of GNI (used for 1-a-1)  
  
Data are imported into R in a variety of ways:  
- the ODA dataset is manually downloaded and saved as a csv. It is then imported into R from the Input folder
- the deflator and exchange rate data are manually downloaded and saved as xlsx files
- GNI data are imported using the OECD API. 
  
The API link for GNI data should not need to be generated again. 
However, for information only, it was generated by going to [https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?ThemeTreeId=3#](OECD.Stat), searching for DAC1 in 'Find in Themes',
opening 'Total flows by donor', selecting 'GNI' in Aid type, and 'United Kingdom' in DAC countries. The sdmx data url was accessed by going to Export > SDMX.
