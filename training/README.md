## Training material for the data team

These training materials require a basic understanding of coding, but are aimed at people with little coding experience. The hope is that these will build confidence so that 
everyone on the team is able to do code reviews, run updates, and fix straightforward issues.  
  
They are designed to be run in the following order
  
1. **Running snippets** - These are some basic exercises that were run alongside a presentation, to help people understand how to run segments of code 
to find out what it does. Answers are given in a separate file. 
2. **Clean code** - This aim of this exercise is to raise awareness of writing code to be human readable. Don't feel you need to clean the whole script as it may be time consuming.
3. **Debug code** - This uses the same script as the clean code exercises, but bugs have been introduced for users to find and fix.
4. **Linking scripts** - Again this uses the same script. The aim of this exercise is to introduce users to the way scripts are set up in this project.
