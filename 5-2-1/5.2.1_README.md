### 5.2.1 update instructions

1) Save the Domestic abuse prevalence and victim characteristics dataset from the Crime Survey for England and Wales. https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/domesticabuseprevalenceandvictimcharacteristicsappendixtables as an xlsx file in the 'Input' folder in 5-2-1 (if this doesn't exist, make it inside the 5-2-1 folder).  
2) Open the `sdg_data_updates.Rproj` from inside RStudio. 
3) Change indicator folder name (`indicator <- "5-2-1"`) 
4) If it exists, open the `config.R` file in 5-2-1 (you can do this in the 'Files' panel in RStudio (usually a tab in the bottom right panel). If not, create from `example_config.R`.
5) Check the configurations (e.g. filename and tab names) are correct, and if not correct them and save. 
6) Open `update_indicator_main.R`.
7. Ensure test_run == TRUE
8. Click Source (by default this is in top right of the script window)  
9. Check for messages in the console. When the script is run a file titled '5-2-1.csv' will be saved in 5-2-1 > Output. Use this file for the Indicator csv.  
10. A file called <date>_5-2-1_checks.html will also be in the outputs folder. Read through this as a QA of the csv. This contains some basic checks and also shows all plots, which should show up any major issues. **Please check this file before copying to the csv**
