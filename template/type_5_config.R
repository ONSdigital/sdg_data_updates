# link for data - see the readme
# ONS CDID (series ID) link generation instructions should be explained in the README file
#   i.e. which selections to use to generate the link. 

# in some cases where CDIDs are available using the excel publication 
# (template 1 or 2) may be better, for example if there are a lot of series.
