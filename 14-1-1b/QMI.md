# Great British Beach Clean plastic litter data for SDG 14.1.1b - Quality and Methodology Information

## About this Quality and Methodology report
This document contains information on the quality characteristics of the data as well as the methods used to create it.  
  
The information in this report will help you to:   
- understand the strengths and limitations of the data  
- learn about existing uses and users of the data  
-	reduce the risk of misusing the data  
-	decide suitable uses for the data  
-	understand the methods used in creating the data  
	 
## Important points
-	Plastic beach litter counts are from data collected during the citizen science project the Great British Beach Clean, 
which has a large sample size.  
-	This dataset is for plastic related litter types only.  
-	The measure used is the median, which gives lower estimates than the mean as used in some other beach litter datasets.   
-	All beach cleans used in these estimates were carried out over a 100m stretch of beach.   
-	Plastic pieces identified as smaller than 2.5cm have been excluded from estimates.   
-	The sample sizes for Northern Ireland are small so these estimates should be used with caution.   
-	Number of volunteers has a complex relationship with litter count and is not controlled for.  
-	2020 figures should not be compared with other years due to much lower volunteer numbers.  
-	Consistently lower volunteer numbers in Wales and Scotland may result in lower litter counts compared to 
England and Northern Ireland, so direct comparisons should not be made between countries.  
-	Changes in which beaches are included each year, and differences in number of volunteers between years reduce 
our ability to draw conclusions about short term changes in litter counts.  

    
## Quality characteristics of the GBBC plastic beach litter statistics 
### Overview
The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) collects data from beach cleans across the UK. In addition to ad-hoc beach cleans they run 
a large citizen science project that is conducted on a single weekend in September each year: the Great British Beach Clean (GBBC). 
This event has occurred every year since 1994.  
  
GBBC data are used in the [UK Natural Capital Habitat Extent and Condition Accounts 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/habitatextentandconditionnaturalcapitaluk/2022)
(and in future the Marine Natural Capital Accounts), and to report [UK data for indicator 14.1.1b (plastic debris density)](https://sdgdata.gov.uk/14-1-1b) of the 
United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This document provides quality and methodology information about the GBBC 
data as used by the ONS.   
  
### Output quality
This document contains a range of information that describes the quality of the data and details any points that should be noted 
when using the output. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has developed Guidelines for measuring statistical quality; these are 
based upon the five European Statistical System (ESS) Quality Dimensions.  
  
This report addresses the following quality dimensions and other important quality characteristics:  
-	relevance  
-	timeliness and punctuality  
-	coherence and comparability  
-	accuracy  
-	output quality trade-offs  
-	geography  
-	accessibility and clarity  
	  
### Relevance
(The degree to which the statistical output meets users’ needs).  
  
The UN metadata for SDG indicator 14.1.1b outlines several methods for monitoring marine plastic litter. 
The GBBC data are relevant for ‘Beach litter from beach surveys’ which is marked as nationally collected data. 
To report GBBC data for this indicator, only items with a plastic component are included in the estimates.  
  
### Timeliness and punctuality
The time lag for ONS to report GBBC data depends on the publication schedules of the Marine Conservation Society 
and of the Marine Natural Capital Accounts.  
  
MCS usually publish their results in November. We aim for the ONS figures for GBBC data to be available within a year of the GBBC event.  
  
### Coherence and comparability
(Coherence is the degree to which data that are derived from different sources or methods, but refer to the same topic, are similar. 
Comparability is the degree to which data can be compared over time and domain, for example, geographical level).
  
#### Coherence
***MCS reporting***  
The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) report results from the Great British Beach Clean (GBBC) each year. The same database is used, 
but with slightly different processing. Differences are summarised in Table 1 below.  
  
#### Table 1. Differences between MCS and ONS reporting of GBBC data at the time of writing
|            |MCS       |ONS       |
|------------|----------|----------|
|**Litter types**|- All litter types, including e.g. metal, wood, cloth </br>- Plastic pieces smaller than 2.5cm are not currently excluded. They will be reported separately in future publications.|- Only types with a plastic component (plastic, rubber, sanitary, medical, and bagged dog faeces).</br>- Plastic pieces smaller than 2.5cm excluded.|
|**Surveys included**|All GBBC cleans|- First clean of the GBBC weekend for each beach.</br>- Surveys of 100m in length only|
|**Measure**|Currently mean count per metre, which results in higher estimates than the mean. May move to reporting the median in future|Median count, which results in lower estimates than the mean|
  
In both datasets, there is a downward trend in litter recorded across the UK.  
  
***OSPAR data***  
MCS report beach litter data for a subset of beaches to 
[OSPAR](https://www.ospar.org/work-areas/eiha/marine-litter/assessment-of-marine-litter/beach-litter) for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Where possible this subset of beaches is monitored quarterly, and the 
[OSPAR Guidelines (PDF, 20.2MB)](https://www.ospar.org/documents?v=7260) for beach litter monitoring is followed.    
    
There are several differences between the GBBC data we report, and the data reported to OSPAR:  
- OSPAR data include non-plastic litter items, such as metal, cloth, and wood which are excluded from our dataset.  
- OSPAR data are for a smaller number of UK beaches (currently 18 beaches).  
- OSPAR data are reported for the OSPAR maritime area rather than at country level.   
  
Direct comparisons between OSPAR data and the GBBC data reported by ONS are therefore not straightforward. However, 
the methods used to collect the data are coherent as both are collected by MCS following a similar methodology.   
  
OSPAR data can be accessed at <https://beachlitter.ospar.org/>.   
  
***UN SDG database***  
At the time of writing, data on beach litter per square kilometre are available for the UK on the 
[UN SDG global database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database). These data are from 
Earth Challenge Integrated Data: Plastic Pollution (MLW, MDMAP, ICC), in which data from multiple organisations, including MCS are combined.   
  
Given the assumptions required to report items per square kilometre, and the variation in litter counts due to 
[number of volunteers](#number-of-volunteers) and [size of area surveyed](#length-of-beach-surveyed), there is likely to be a higher degree 
of error in these data compared to the GBBC data reported by ONS.  
  
While the scale is different (items per km<sup>2</sup> not items per 100m stretch), there is a strong overall downward trend in both the 
data reported on the UN global SDG database and the GBBC data reported by ONS.   
  
#### Comparability  
Data are presented for each of the constituent countries of the UK, but direct comparisons should not be made between them. 
There are consistent differences between countries in the number of volunteers that take part in the survey [(Figure 6)](#figure-6-number-of-volunteers-over-time-uk-2008-to-2021): Wales and Scotland have slightly lower numbers of volunteers than England and Northern Ireland. As volunteer number is not controlled for, this 
may lead to lower litter counts in Wales and Scotland than England and Northern Ireland.  
  
The number of volunteers that took part in 2020 beach cleans was significantly lower than in other years. 2020 data should therefore 
not be compared to other years as they are likely to under-estimate litter present.   
  
The number of volunteers that took part in the 2021 event was higher than in other years, though the difference is not as marked as 
in 2020. 2021 data should also therefore be treated with caution as, all else being equal, they are likely to give a higher estimate 
of litter in comparison with other years.   
  
Changes in volunteer numbers and the composition of beaches vary over time and are likely to impact estimates. Short term changes in litter count should therefore be treated with caution. However, long term trends are unlikely to be heavily impacted as there are no clear long term trends in [number of volunteers](#number-of-volunteers) or 
[composition of beaches across years](#composition-of-beaches-across-years).  
  
### Accuracy
(The degree of closeness between an estimate and the true value.)  
  
A key strength of the Great British Beach Clean citizen science data is the large sample size, which may give a more representative and precise estimate than datasets with a smaller sample. However, in the original dataset from MCS there are inconsistencies in   
- number of volunteers  
- length of beach surveyed   
- average width of surveyed beaches  
- composition of beaches across years (sample composition)  
- frequency of cleans  
- recording of small items  
   
We assess the potential impact of these variables on trends over time and across countries and explain if and how we have accounted for them in the final dataset.  
   
#### Length of beach surveyed
There is a lot of variation in the length of beach surveyed in the full GBBC dataset, particularly prior to 2010 (Figure 1). 
  
#### Figure 1. Length of beach surveyed over time, UK, 1994 to 2021
![Figure 1. shows a boxplot for each constiturent country, with boxes for each year. There is a decrease in the length of beach surveyed over time for all constituent countries of the UK. All have a median length of about 100m by 2011](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure1.png)   
> *Boxplot showing changes in length of beach surveyed over time, and differences between countries. The red line shows 100m. For ease of 	
> viewing, the y axis has been cropped at 5000m*
  
As surveys over longer stretches of beach naturally result in a larger number of items collected, we need to control for it. 
Whilst litter count per metre could be used to control for beach length (and is used in other reports), it does not completely 
remove the effect of beach length on number of litter items recorded: [Figure 2](#figure-2-litter-count-per-metre-decreases-with-length-surveyed-uk-1994-to-2021) shows that there is an effect of length surveyed on the litter count per metre, with higher counts per metre for shorter surveys up to about 500m. This could 
be explained by the following:  
- volunteers may be more likely to start surveys at the point on the beach with most litter  
- volunteers conducting shorter surveys may be more diligent in picking up litter, particularly smaller items   
  
#### Figure 2. Litter count per metre decreases with length surveyed, UK, 1994 to 2021 
![Figure 2. shows a plot with length surveyed (in metres) on the x axis, and plastic litter count per metre on the y axis.
A cloud of pale blue datapoints show the plastic count for each beach. They are concentrated in the bottom left of the plot, with a
long tail of points to the right. All high count points are on the far left of the chart. A smoothed black line starts at just over 
20 plastic pieces per metre at about 10m distance surveyed. The black line decreases sharply to a short plateau around 100m and a 
count of about 7. From about 150m the black line drops again, but less sharply, and plateaus at around 500m at a very low count](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure2.png)
>*The dashed line highlights 100m. The black line is a smoothed best fit line. The default gam smoothed function from R’s ggplot::stat_smooth function > was used ( formula: y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")). For ease of viewing, the y axis has been cropped at 125, and the x axis has been cropped at  1500m.*

[Figure 1](#figure-1-length-of-beach-surveyed-over-time-uk-1994-to-2021) shows a clear reduction in the length of surveys over time, and by 2015 most surveys were of 100m. If the number of litter items on beaches was constant over time, we would see an increase in litter count per metre due to a decrease in the average length of beach surveyed. By not adequately accounting for length of survey, data would therefore be misleading.  
  
To assess the impact of change in length surveyed over time, we compared median litter count per metre for the full dataset with a dataset comprising 100m surveys only.  As expected, litter count per metre was consistently lower for the full dataset than the 100m-only dataset across all countries (the full dataset includes more surveys over 100m than surveys under 100m).   
  
The trend over time differs considerably between the two datasets. For example, data from the full dataset suggest that there was a clear and consistent increase in litter on English beaches between 2011 and 2017, while data from 100m surveys does not (Figure 3).   
  
#### Figure 3. Restricting the sample to surveys of 100m results in higher estimates of litter density   
![Figure 3 shows a line plot for the UK and each of the constituent countries, with year on the horizontal axis, and median plastic litter count 
on the vertical axis. On each plot there is a red line for surveys of 100m and a blue line for surveys of any length. In every plot, the line
for surveys of 100m is almost always higher than the line for surveys of any length until between 2015 and 2017 when the two lines become very
similar. The line for surveys of 100m is jerkier than the line for surveys of any length but becomes smoother when the two lines converge. 
The plot for Northern Ireland is much jerkier than the others.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure3.png)  
  
Removal of surveys that are not 100m in length reduces the sample size ([Table 2](#table-2-number-of-surveys-by-year-and-country-uk-2000-to-2020)) and thus increases the volatility of the series, particularly in earlier years and for Northern Ireland. However, because the change in length surveyed over time has such a strong impact on the trend in litter count over time, we limited the final dataset to surveys where the length of beach surveyed was 100m.
Earlier years have smaller sample sizes, especially in the reduced dataset. In 2007 no Northern Ireland beaches are included in the sample. We therefore start the reported series in 2008.

#### Width of beach
The average width of the surveyed beach was not always recorded. However, the effect of beach width on the number of items recorded per beach was neither large nor did it show a clear trend ([Figures 4](#figure-4) and [5](#figure-5)). The lowest counts were seen in surveys where the average width of surveyed beach was less than about 15m [Figure 4](figure-4-average-width-of-surveyed-beach-has-no-clear-impact-on-litter-count-for-100m-surveys-uk-19940-to-2021). However, where it has been recorded, there is no clear trend in the average width of beach surveyed over time, nor differences between countries [Figure 5](figure-5-no-clear-trend-in-average-width-of-surveyed-beach-over-time-UK-2008-to-2021). Therefore, any variance in litter count estimate caused by the width of beach surveyed is unlikely to have introduced bias into the results.  
  
#### Figure 4. Average width of surveyed beach has no clear impact on litter count for 100m surveys, UK, 1994 to 2021 
![Figure 4 shows 4 plots, one for each of the UK's constituent countries. Average width of beach in metres is on the horizontal axis,
and litter count per survey is on the vertical axis. Pale blue points show the indicidual surveys. These points are densest towards the left of
each plot and are clustered at standard widths, for example 10m, 20m, 30m. Lines of blue points are particularly dense at 50 and 100m. A black line with grey confidence intervals runs in a slightly wavy fashion horizontally through the points at about 500. The confidence interval is very narrow.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure4.png)  
  
#### Figure 5. No clear trend in average width of surveyed beach over time, UK, 2008 to 2021  
![Figure 5 shows 4 boxplots, one for each of the UK's constituent countries. Year is on the horizontal access and there is a box for each year. The vertical axis shows the average width of beach in metres. England has the most outliers. The third quartile (the top of the box) is approximately 50 on most plots and years. There is no obvious pattern accross years and there are no major obvious differences between countries.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure5.png) 

#### Number of volunteers
Number of volunteers fluctuates over time and there are slight differences between countries ([Figure 6](figure-6-number-of-volunteers-over-time-uk-2008-to-2021)). Volunteer numbers for Scotland and Wales are, in most years, lower than those in England and Northern Ireland. This may have led to deflated litter counts in Scotland and Wales compared to England and Northern Ireland. As such, comparisons of litter counts should not be made between countries (though overall trends may be compared). 
  
#### Figure 6. Number of volunteers over time, UK, 2008 to 2021  
![Figure 6 shows 4 boxplots, one for each of the UK's constituent countries. Year is on the horizontal access and there is a box for each year. The vertical axis shows the number of volunteers. There is a red line that runs across each plot at 10 volunteers. This red line runs through all boxes on all plots, relatively close to the median, except for 2020. The 2020 box is below the line on all four plots.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure6.png)
> *Boxplot of the number of volunteers in each year by country. The red line indicates 10 volunteers and has been included purely as a visual aid to assess changes over time and between countries.*
  
There is no clear trend in volunteer numbers over time, however in 2020 they were significantly lower than in previous years due to covid restrictions.  We would expect this to lead to lower litter counts in 2020. 2020 figures should therefore be treated with caution.  
  
Number of volunteers affects the number of litter items recorded. However, the relationship between number of volunteers and number of litter items recorded is not straightforward: The impact of the number of volunteers is larger when the duration of the survey is shorter. For surveys with a long duration there is little effect of the number of volunteers on the number of litter items recorded. In addition, there is a quadratic effect of volunteer number: an increase of one volunteer has a smaller effect when there are many volunteers than when there are few volunteers.  
  
To reduce the impact of fluctuations in volunteer numbers, we could limit the number of volunteers to a particular range. However, in contrast to limiting the length of beach surveyed to 100m, we would not be able to completely remove the problem. In addition, the sample size would be substantially reduced. We therefore decided to retain all records regardless of number of volunteers.   
   
#### Composition of beaches across years
Not all beaches were surveyed every year, thus the sample composition changes over time. In addition, the exclusion of surveys that were not 100m in length is likely to have reduced the consistency of beach inclusion (the sample) over time.   
  
It is possible that changes in the composition of the sample over time could impact overall trends. For example, if beaches that usually have a lot of litter are over-represented in earlier years and beaches that are usually quite clean are over-represented in later years, we would expect to see a decrease in litter over time.  
  
There is a relatively high repeatability in litter count within beaches (R = 0.49, SE =0.02, R function ‘rptR’, years 2008 to 2021, surveys of 100m, one survey per beach per year, volunteer number and duration of survey controlled for in the model). To assess how the composition of beaches changes over time, we therefore classified beaches as either ‘clean’, ‘dirty’, or ‘neutral’. Each beach had a single classification that did not change across years (see below for methods). We plotted the proportion of beaches in each category over time, by country (Figure 7).   
  
#### Figure 7. Proportion of beaches that usually (over all years) have more or less litter than the average GBBC beach for that year and country, 2008-2021
![Figure 7 shows 4 line plots, one for each of the UK's constituent countries. Year is on the horizontal access. The vertical axis shows the proportion of beaches. There is a line that runs horizontally across each plot at 0.5. There are two lines on each plot: a red line showing the proportion of beaches designated as clean, and a blue line showing the proportion of beaches designated as dirty. In all plots the red and blue lines criss-cross and mostly fall below the 0.5 line.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure7.png)  
>*Some beaches were classified as neutral, but for ease of viewing, they have not been included in this figure. For this reason, proportions do not sum to 1.*  
  
For England, the proportions of ‘clean’ and ‘dirty’ beaches are quite similar and close to 50% for each type.  
  
For Scotland and Wales between 2015 and 2020 the proportions of clean and dirty beaches are quite similar and close to 50% for each type. However, in both Scotland and Wales in 2013 and 2014 ‘dirty’ beaches were over-represented and ‘clean’ beaches were under-represented. The large distance from 50% is at least partly due to smaller sample sizes [Table 2](#table-2-number-of-surveys-by-year-and-country-UK-2000-to-2020).   
  
For Northern Ireland, between 2017 and 2019 ‘clean’ beaches are over-represented, and in 2015 and 2016, they are under-represented. However, until 2014 the proportions of clean and dirty beaches are similar.   
  
There is no clear evidence of bias due to changes in sample composition over the longer-term. However, the extra noise created by changes in sample composition should be taken into consideration when drawing conclusions about short term changes in litter count over time.  
  
##### Methods for assessing sample composition across years
Data were restricted to 100m cleans between 2008 and 2021.   
  
The overall median litter counts for each year and country were calculated. The following scores were then allocated for each beach in each year:  
- above median = 1  
- equal to median = 0  
- below median = -1  
   
The score for each beach was then summed across all years in which it was surveyed. Beaches with a positive total were classified ‘dirty’; those with a negative score were classified ‘clean’; beaches with a total score of 0 were classified ‘neutral’. Neutral beaches are not shown in the plots.  
  
#### Frequency of cleans
A key limitation of the GBBC data (and of many beach litter datasets) is that there is variation in the length of time since beaches were last cleaned. Whilst there is information in the GBBC dataset on when beaches were last known to be cleaned, organisers may not have accurate information, as any member of the public may pick up litter without informing anyone. This information is also not available for the full time series.    
    
Nevertheless, we looked at whether the shortest known interlude between cleans had a noticeable impact on litter count (where length surveyed was 100m).  
  
We found no clear effect of interlude on litter count ([Figure 8](figure-8-effect-of-shortest-known-time-since-last-clean-on-litter-count-for-interludes-of-up-to-300-days-UK-2008-to-2021); shorter interludes were also plotted with similar results). However, this may be due to error around the interlude. In addition, results may be confounded by the effect of beach cleanliness on frequency of cleans. In other words, heavily littered beaches may be cleaned more frequently, and beaches that stay quite clean may not be cleaned as often.  
  
#### Figure 8. Effect of shortest known time since last clean on litter count for interludes of up to 300 days, UK, 2008 to 2021  
![Figure 8 is a scatterplot with shortest known number of days since the last clean on the horizontal axis, and plastic litter count on the y axis. A slightly wavy but flat flat horizontal line runs through the points](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure8.png)

As it seems quite likely that there could be a relationship between cleaning frequency and amount of litter present (though this isn’t apparent in the data – see possible explanations above), we looked at whether there are trends in the interlude between cleans over time.  
  
We found no major differences across years in the number of days since the last clean, though there may be a trend toward shorter interludes over time (Figure 9).

#### Figure 9. Temporal trends in interlude between cleans based on organiser notes, UK, 2012 to 2020
 ![Figure 9 has year on the horizontal axis, and number of days since last known clean on the vertical access. For each year there is a cloud of jittered semi-transparent points that are contentrated towards the bottom of the chart. There are more points for later years than earlier years. For each year there is also one larger red point with a vertical line running through it to show the median and the interquartile range. For all years with a decent number of points (2015 to 2020) the inter-quartile range is very similar.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure9.png)

#### Reporting of small items (and use of the median)
As suggested by CEMAPS methodology, plastic pioeces under 2.5cm have been excluded from litter counts as small items are less likely to be seen, collected, and reported. In addition they cannot be allocated to a source. Polypellets (also known as mermaid's tears, or nurdles) are also not counted. However, some counts of small items remain in the dataset under ‘other’ categories. This is clear from the descriptions given by volunteers: despite guidance to not count items such as polypellets, these are included in several entries under 'other'. Removal of every such case would be difficult, so rather than excluding a subset, all such counts have been retained.   
  
It is apparent from the descriptions given that there may be differences in count precision depending on the volunteer or the state of items when found. For example, a pack of wet wipes may be counted as "1 pack of wet wipes" or as "100 wet wipes".   
  
Where data are heavily right skewed and there are many outliers, the median tends to be a better measure of central tendency. These data are both heavily right skewed and include a lot of outliers. Outliers may, in part, be due to differences in counting (every tissue vs. one pack of tissues), and inclusion of small items.
Due to the large number of outliers (some of which may be caused by the issues outlined above), and the heavy right skew of the data (Figure 10)[#figure-10-number-of-plastic-litter-items-recorded-per-beach-UK-2008-to-2021] we report median count rather than mean count. Doing so results in lower estimates and reduces noise to some extent (Figure 11)[#figure-11-use-of-the-median-gives-a-lower-estimate-of-litter-density-compared-to-the-mean].  
  
#### Figure 10. Number of plastic litter items recorded per beach, UK, 2008 to 2021  
![Figure 10 has year on the horizontal axis, and plastic litter count for 100m cleans on the vertical access. For each year there is a cloud of jittered semi-transparent points that are concentrated in the bottom quarter of the chart, with the vast majority of points being relatively close to 0. For each year there is also one larger red point with a vertical line running through it to show the median and the interquartile range. The line above the median is longer than the line below the point in all years, and in some years the line below the point can't be seen.](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Images/figure10.png)

### Output quality trade-offs
(Trade-offs are the extent to which different dimensions of quality are balanced against each other).  
  
One of the major benefits of the Great British Beach Clean citizen science data is the large sample size, which may give more representative and precise estimates than datasets with smaller sample sizes. However, compared to the data submitted to OSPAR for the MSFD, there is less consistency in variables such as number of volunteers, length of beach surveyed, and which beaches are included in the data each year. There is a trade-off between retaining all data and thus maximising sample size, and the impact of some of these variables on other aspects of output quality. We assessed the potential impact of these variables on trends over time and across countries in the [Accuracy section](#accuracy) above.  
  
Following assessment of length of beach surveyed, we restricted the output data to surveys where the length of beach surveyed was recorded as 100m. This reduced the sample sizes, particularly in earlier years and in Northern Ireland ([Table 2](#table-2-number-of-surveys-by-year-and-country-uk-2000-to-2020)). However, we considered it necessary to do so as data from the full dataset led to potentially misleading trends in litter counts over time. Due to sample sizes we only report data from 2008 onwards n the output.  
  
We did not restrict the dataset to a set number of volunteers as this would have had a large impact on sample size and would not remove all variation in volunteer number. Unlike length of beach surveyed, there is also no clear trend in volunteer number over time, so the benefit of restricting the dataset would be limited.
Due to unusually low volunteer numbers in 2020, 2020 data should be treated with caution.  
  
### Geography
We report median litter count by each of the constituent countries of the UK, and for the UK as a whole. However, it should be noted that no weightings are used, so some areas of the UK may be over-represented in the UK total.  
  
### Accessibility and clarity
(Accessibility is the ease with which users can access the data, also reflecting the format in which the data are available and the availability of supporting information. Clarity refers to the quality and sufficiency of the release details, illustrations and accompanying advice.)  
  
Data are annually made publicly available on the UK SDG platform. Data are presented graphically, and machine readable data can be downloaded. The UK SDG platform has an [accessibility rating of AA](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/index.php/ons-sustainable-development-goals/).  
  
### Methods used to produce the GBBC beach litter statistics
#### MCS survey method
The Marine Conservation Society’s Great British Beach Clean is a citizen science project that occurs every year on the second weekend of September.   
  
Organisers of beach cleans are given guidance on best practice by MCS. Transects along beaches are carried out between the back of the beach and the strandline. Best practice guidelines indicate that 100m transects are preferred, however this is not always the case (see [Length of beach surveyed](#length-of-beach-surveyed). Volunteers collect all litter items and note the number and type of items using litter identification guides provided by MCS. Types of litter are classified under the following material groups: plastic, polystyrene, rubber, cloth, metal, medical, sanitary, faeces, paper, wood, glass, and ceramic/pottery. Poly-pellets (also known as nurdles or mermaid’s tears) are recorded as present or absent but are not counted (though see note in [Reporting of small items](#reporting-of-small-items-and-use-of-the-median).  
  
At the end of the survey, survey co-ordinators validate the items and report data to MCS. MCS then conduct further quality control.    
  
#### Data processing
MCS provides the ONS with all plastic-related data (material groups: plastic, polystyrene, rubber, medical, sanitary, bagged faeces).  
  
We restricted data to cases where the length of beach cleaned was 100m (see [Length of beach surveyed](#length-of-beach-surveyed)).  We removed data for beaches in the Republic of Ireland and the Channel Islands.  
  
Some beaches were surveyed multiple times over the GBBC weekend. We retained only the first entry during the GBBC weekend for each beach each year. We took this approach to avoid including multiple cleans of the same stretch of beach over a short period of time.   
  
We classified a subset of litter items according to their suspected origin using a [guide produced by MCS](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg_data_updates/blob/14-1-1b/14-1-1b/Example_input/beachwatch_sources_2021_1.0.csv).  
   
For each constituent country, we calculated the median number of items, and the median number of items by suspected origin.
